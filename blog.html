        <h2>What is the difference between local storage and session storage ?</h2>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
            localStorage doesn't expire, data in
            sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab
            in the browser,
            a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

        <h2>what is the difference between global scoped and block scoped ?</h2>
        <p><b>Answer :</b>Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

            Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.Variables declared inside a { } block
            cannot be accessed from outside the block. var is global scoped on the other hand let and const is block
            scoped</p>

        <h2>What is event loop ?</h2>
        <p><b>Answer:</b>The event loop is the secret behind JavaScripts asynchronous programming. JS executes all
            operations on a single
            thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.</p>

        <p>
        <ol>
            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            <li>In JavaScript if a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, is automatically
                assigned the value
                undefined .</li>
            <li>You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.</li>
